## The Problem

You find a great article. A table you need. A code snippet. Documentation. You copy it and paste it into Notion, Obsidian, ChatGPT, your notes app — and it looks like garbage.

Broken formatting. Raw HTML. Walls of unstyled text.

You spend 3 minutes manually fixing what should have taken 3 seconds.

**Copy as Markdown fixes this.**

---

## What It Does

Select any content on any webpage. Right-click → **Copy as Markdown** or hit `Ctrl+Shift+M`.

The selected HTML is instantly converted to clean, properly formatted Markdown and placed on your clipboard. No popups. No settings screen. No account. No internet connection required. **It just works.**

<!-- Add a demo GIF here: record a short clip selecting text and using the shortcut, then upload to the repo as assets/demo.gif -->

## Everything It Converts

| HTML | Markdown |
| --- | --- |
| `<h1>` – `<h6>` | `#` `##` `###` headings |
| `<strong>`, `<b>` | `**bold**` |
| `<em>`, `<i>` | `*italic*` |
| `<del>`, `<s>` | `~~strikethrough~~` |
| `<a href="...">` | `[text](url)` |
| `<img src="...">` | `![alt](src)` |
| `<ul>`, `<ol>` | Nested lists with proper indentation |
| `<table>` | Full GFM pipe table syntax |
| `<pre><code>` | Fenced code blocks with language detection |
| `<blockquote>` | `> blockquote` |
| `<p>` | Clean paragraphs |

---

## Two Ways to Use It

### 1. Right-click menu
Select text → right-click → choose your action:
- **Copy as Markdown** — copies to clipboard instantly
- **Save as Markdown file** — downloads a `.md` file named after the page title

### 2. Keyboard shortcut

| Platform | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Windows / Linux | `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `M` |
| macOS | `Cmd` + `Shift` + `M` |

---

## Privacy First

- **Zero network requests** — nothing leaves your machine
- **No telemetry** — no analytics, no tracking, no logging
- **No account** — no sign-in, no email, no onboarding
- **Open source** — read every line of code yourself

---

## Install from Source

### Chrome, Edge, or Brave

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sulmatajb/copy-as-markdown.git

## CLI — For AI Agents and Pipelines

A companion Node.js CLI fetches any URL and outputs clean Markdown to stdout. Designed for piping into AI tools, scripts, and automation workflows.

```bash
# No install required
npx copy-as-markdown https://example.com/article

# Save to file
npx copy-as-markdown https://example.com/article > article.md

# Pipe into an LLM
npx copy-as-markdown https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12345 | llm "summarize this"

# Include page title as H1
npx copy-as-markdown https://example.com/post --title
```

### CLI Options

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--title` | Prepend the page title as an H1 heading |
| `--no-readability` | Skip article extraction — convert the full page body |
| `--help` | Show usage |

### Install globally

```bash
npm install -g copy-as-markdown
```

## Why This Exists

AI workflows, note-taking, and writing in Markdown are now mainstream. But the web still serves HTML. Every researcher, developer, writer, and analyst who uses tools like Obsidian, Notion, Logseq, ChatGPT, or VS Code hits this friction dozens of times a day. This extension removes it entirely — no friction, no dependencies, no cloud, no cost.
